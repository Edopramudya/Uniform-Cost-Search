# Nearest Parking Finder 🚗

This project implements the **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)** algorithm to determine the nearest parking location from a starting point on a campus. It provides both textual results and a graphical visualization of the path and costs.

---

## Features ✨
- Finds the nearest parking node based on user input.
- Visualizes the graph with highlighted paths and costs using Matplotlib.
- Highlights:
  - **Yellow**: Starting node.
  - **Red**: Nearest parking node.
  - **Green**: Other parking nodes.

---

## How It Works ⚙️
1. Input your starting location (A-K).
2. The program calculates:
   - The nearest parking node.
   - The path and total cost.
3. Outputs both the result and a graph visualization.

---

## Installation 🔧
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Matplotlib (`pip install matplotlib`).
3. Run the program to find your nearest parking.
